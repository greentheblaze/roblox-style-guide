# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The "Unreleased" section to resolve a violation of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), which was caused by listing a feature that may be worked on in the future under this section, despite no prior development having been started.

- A typo in [the link of release 0.2.0 in this CHANGELOG](https://github.com/greentheblaze/roblox-style-guide/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#020---2026-02-21), which did not create a comparison from that release to the previous one ([0.1.0]).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- [Shield badges](https://shields.io/) for latest releases, the [LICENSE], and our Discord server to [README.md][readme] so navigation is easier.

### Changed

- All details in this repository associated with a now-redundant organization - including all links and [copyright information][license] - after repository ownership transfer.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a standardized open source project CHANGELOG.
